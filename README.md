What is the Meme Generator?
It's a free online image maker that allows you to add custom resizable text to images. 
It operates in HTML5 canvas, so your images are created instantly on your own device. 
Most commonly, people use the generator to add text captions to established memes, so technically it's more of a meme "captioner" than a meme maker. 
However, you can also upload your own images as templates.

This project build with Vanila javascript HTML and CSS.
